## How to Play

The game is pretty straightforward. First choose your character. The green bar represents their health. The red bar represents their attack strength. 

Then select which enemy you would like to duel first. Click on the attack button to attack them. The text at the bottom of the screen will tell you how much damage you and your enemy are inflicting on each other. With each attack, your character's attack strength will increase.

When you beat all of the remaining enemies, you win.
